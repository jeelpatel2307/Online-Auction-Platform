# Online Auction Platform

This project is a simple implementation of an online auction platform in Java.

## Description

The project consists of two main classes:

1. **Item**: Represents an item being auctioned. It contains attributes such as name, description, and current bid amount.

2. **AuctionPlatform**: Represents the online auction platform. It allows users to add items, place bids on items, and display available items with their current bids.

## Usage

To use the Online Auction Platform:

1. Compile the Java files (`Item.java`, `AuctionPlatform.java`, and `Main.java`).
2. Run the `Main` class, which demonstrates how to add items, place bids, and display available items.

## Features

- Add new items to the auction platform.
- Place bids on existing items.
- Display available items with their current bids.

## Example

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        AuctionPlatform platform = new AuctionPlatform();

        // Add items to the auction platform
        platform.addItem("Painting", "Beautiful landscape painting");
        platform.addItem("Antique Watch", "Rare vintage wristwatch");

        // Display available items
        platform.displayItems();

        // Place bids
        platform.placeBid("Painting", 200.0);
        platform.placeBid("Antique Watch", 500.0);
        platform.placeBid("Antique Watch", 600.0);

        // Display updated bids
        platform.displayItems();
    }
}

```
